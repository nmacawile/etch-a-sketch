## Drawing
Hover your mouse across the canvas with the `PEN` tool on. You can toggle the `PEN` tool on/off with the number `1` key (not `NUMPAD 1`) on your keyboard.

## The tools
There are three tools to choose from: 1) `PEN`, 2) `COLORS`, and 3) `BURN`.

Note: All tool keys are assigned to the keyboard numbers below the function keys, not the `NUMPAD` numbers.

### PEN
Blackens the target 1x1 square. It is assigned to the key `1`.

### COLORS
Paints the 3x3 area with a random color. It was designed so that the generated value is close to the previously generated one for smoother transition. It is assigned to the key `2`.

### BURN
Darkens the target 3x3 area with a focus in the center. Partially burned (grayish) can still be colored but they will apear slightly darker. Totally burned (black) areas won't be affected by the `COLOR` tool.  It is assigned to the key `3`.

## Changing tools
You can switch anytime by pressing their assigned keys on your keyboard. Pressing the key of the tool currently in use will toggle it off, allowing you to move your cursor along the canvas without messing up your drawing.

## Clearing the canvas
Hit the `SPACE` key to clear your current canvas.

## Changing the resolution of the canvas
Press `0` key to generate a new canvas. You will be allowed to set your desired resolution. You can generate up to 128x128 canvas but you may experience some hiccups during the generation process depending on your system.
